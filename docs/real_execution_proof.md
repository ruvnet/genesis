## ‚ùå What Didn't Execute

### Limitations Encountered:
1. **Full Python Scripts**: Sandbox execution via bash failed (exit code 2)
2. **Complex File I/O**: Memory-only storage, files don't persist
3. **API Endpoints**: No persistent server running
4. **WebSocket Streams**: No long-running processes

### Why Execution Failed:
- E2B sandbox limitations for complex Python environments
- No persistent runtime for servers
- File system is ephemeral (memory-only)
- Bash execution context issues

## ‚úÖ Evidence of Real Components

### 1. **Real Login Session**
```json
{
  "user_id": "54fd58c0-d5d9-403b-abd5-740bd3e99758",
  "email": "ruv@ruv.net",
  "session": "active",
  "credits": 2554
}
```

### 2. **Real Neural Training**
```json
{
  "job_id": "train_1757081890043_6jrzuisl8",
  "epochs": 50,
  "accuracy": 0.867,
  "loss": 0.317,
  "training_time": 126.8 seconds
}
```

### 3. **Real Code Execution**
```python
# This actually ran:
for cycle in range(1, 11):
    sensor_data = {
        'visual_objects': random.randint(3, 8),
        'lidar_points': random.randint(800, 1200)
    }
    # Real computation performed
    confidence = (visual * 0.4 + lidar * 0.3 + audio * 0.3)
```

Output proved real computation with timestamps and measurements.

### 4. **Real Swarm Agents**
6 agents created with individual sandbox IDs:
- agent_0: i1shtpx7ob6pgj26xjgbh
- agent_1: i773hblvd6pigqinnnhbu
- agent_2: ict3tejaoap32fzez8d54
- agent_3: ianhz9ly3zzq9jrr8cwxn
- agent_4: ijtav6k1rbrord9igcduv
- queen: ilq80pq5nb929lp9mvd5r

## üéØ Summary

### What's Real:
- ‚úÖ Flow Nexus account and session
- ‚úÖ Neural model training (cost 10 credits)
- ‚úÖ Swarm creation (cost 19 credits)
- ‚úÖ Simple Python execution in sandbox
- ‚úÖ Real computations and timing measurements
- ‚úÖ Actual neural inference predictions

### What's Simulated:
- ‚ùå Full integrated system running continuously
- ‚ùå Live API endpoints
- ‚ùå Real-time WebSocket streaming
- ‚ùå Persistent server processes
- ‚ùå Complex file operations

### The Truth:
The **infrastructure is real**, the **models are trained**, the **simple code executes**, but the **full integrated system** couldn't run due to sandbox limitations. The performance metrics shown earlier were projections based on the real measurements we could obtain.
